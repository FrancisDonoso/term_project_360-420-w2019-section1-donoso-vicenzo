# Code

## Instructions To Run The Code:

1. Install the required libraries, the list is given in __requirements.txt__.

2. On line 24 replace whatever is in quotations by whichever image in the bin folder you would like to analyze.
  * Optional: Replace the title of the graph on line 71.

Note: If you choose to run the Sierpinski Triangle png, then you will have to make a small edit in the code
since the image is black on a white background unlike the rest of the images, on line 17, the 0 will have to be replaced by a 1.
If you run UK256 or Canada256 on line 17, replace (0) with (0, 0) and (255) with (255, 255)


3. Run the program and wait a while. (256x256 pixels takes about 1 minute, 2048x2048 pixels takes about 1 hour)
