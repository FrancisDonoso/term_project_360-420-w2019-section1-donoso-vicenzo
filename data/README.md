# Data

Included in this file are:

  * Graphs of the 5 shapes we tested
    The plots compare the logarithm of the scaling factor versus the logarithm of the boxes filled.
    The slope of the regression line (a.k.a the dimension) is the title of the plot.

      1. Coast of Canada
      2. Coast of Britain
      3. Full Square
      4. Full Circle
      5. Sierpinski Triangle

  * A text file showing how many boxes were filled on each iteration, for each shape.
    Also in that file, the dimensions of a 'box' and the total number of boxes in that iteration.
